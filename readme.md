There are two files of importance here.

- `parse-xml.js` - This has the actual parsing function.
- `test/test.js` - This has the unit tests written using Mocha and Chai.

Run `npm i` to install mocha and chai.

Run either `mocha` or `npm run test` to run the mocha tests.

I was working on the latest version of Node (v7.1.0).

There is a lot of code in here that could be written in a few less lines,
but I wanted to flesh it out and assign to lots of variables so that you
can hopefully follow my way of thinking.
